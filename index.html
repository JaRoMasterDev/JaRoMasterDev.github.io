          Hi! <br />I'm JaRoMaster, a 15 years old developer with nearly two
          years of experience! In the last two years I tried some different
          programming concepts and languages and I'm currently focussing on web
          and app development.

            When I started looking into web development, I started learning
            React because of its simplicity and I really fell in love with it.
            During an internship at a local company I made my first experience
            with React-Native. I got into it quickly because of my earlier
            experience with React and the company offered me a small job as a
            junior-developer next to school. <br />I'm still working at that
            company while going to school and I'm learning many new things in
            connection with React-Native and app-development in general
          </p>

        <div class="skill">
          <p class="title">Unity (C#)</p>
          <div class="progressbar"><div class="progress two"></div></div>
          <p class="desc">
            I started programming because I saw some people on the internet
            learning developing games and it seemed pretty easy. During Covid I
            had a lot of free time and looked into 2D game development. I began
            creating some simple games and learned the basics of programming
            with Unity and C#. Later, when I was more experienced and knew a lot
            more about different languages and programming in general I got into
            game development again. I looked into 3D-development and the basics
            of 3D-modelling before feeling the need to try something else and
            learning web development.

          <div class="progressbar"><div class="progress three"></div></div>
          <p class="desc">
            Long story short: <br />Before getting into React I learned the
            basic HTML and CSS web development and got more and more experienced
            because of it's wide use in React and while using it to build
            smaller websites like this portfolio.

          <p class="desc">
            After I started my programming journey with Unity and C# I wanted to
            know what Python is. I heard a lot about it and it seemed easy to
            learn.<br />I learned a lot of the basics about programming, machine
            learning, networks and computers in general.
